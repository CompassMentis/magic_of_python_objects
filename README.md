Part of my PyCon DE (Germany) presentation, April 2022.

For more information (mainly the slides) see https://www.betterpythoncode.com/pycon-de-2022-talk-the-magic-of-python-objects/

During the talk I extended some existing code using dunder ('magic') methods to make the classes behave more like standard Python objects.

After the talk, without the pressure of doing live coding, I created slightly better versions of the code, which you'll find in this repository.

Because this uses '=' in f-strings you will need Python 3.8 or higher to run it.

The image_folder example needs a folder which contains one or more images and no other (non-image) files. Line 38 of image_folder.py specifies the name and location of this folder.
